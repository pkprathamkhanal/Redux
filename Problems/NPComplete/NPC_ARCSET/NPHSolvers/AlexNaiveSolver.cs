                                        sourced from the below Wikipedia page. It works as follows:
                                        Essentially it orders edges into two categories, decending and ascending. Then only returns the bigger set. 
                                        This will guarantee all cycles are broken. This solver specifically makes use of a DFS (Depth First Search), where the graph is ordered into descending edges and back edges.
                                        This allows the removal of all backedges, breaking cycles in a less arbitrary way. 
                                        Note that technically, this will leave one back edge in, because the goal is to return an instance of ARCSET (ie. minimum cyclical graph), as opposed the maximum acyclical subgraph.
                                        This solver has an approximation ratio of 1/2.";
