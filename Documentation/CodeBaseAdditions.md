## Branching Routines

The primary branch of the repository used for production is CSharpAPI. Additions to this branch should only be made through the merging of the develop branch after a code review from a different developer whenever possible. Currently, most code additions are made directly to the develop branch and we have had little issue with merge conflicts. As more people begin adding to the code base, it may make more sense to branch off of the develop branch. Once a task is finished merge your own code into the develop branch. To do so create a pull request, and assign a reviewer. The person who completes the code review will then complete the pull request. DO NOT COMPLETE THE PULL REQUEST BEFORE IT IS REVIEWED.


## Adding to code base

### Problems
New problems should be added to the back-end repository in the Problems/NPComplete folder. (Currently, the back end is only set up to handle NP-complete problems. If other problems are added in the future, where those are to be placed will need to be determined.) All files relating to a problem should be put in a folder titled NPC_PROBLEMNAME. This folder should include 4 files/folders.

- A file named PROBLEMNAME\textunderscore class.cs       
- A folder named "Solvers"
- A folder named "Verifiers"
- A file named PROBLEMNAME\textunderscore controller.cs

*any NPHFolders contain code for a NP-Hard version of that problem, and include deprecated code, that may be useful as the code base is expanded.
    
#### Problem Class
The PROBLEMNAME\textunderscore class.cs should implement the ProblemI interface found in ProblemInterface.cs. This includes 

- string problemName : Human readable problem name, this is what the problem will appear as in the GUI
- string formalDefinition : Definition in the form of {<problem variables> | "definition" }
- string problemDefinition : A more easily readable form of the above definition.
- string source : A formal citation of the source material for the problem definition
- string wikiName : This is deprecated, and should be removed from all problems
- string defaultInstance : A reasonably sized example of the problem, and the necessary format. *if the problem is of a similar form to an existing problem, such as a directed graph, the format should match the existing problems.
- string[] contributors : A list of names of all developers who have worked on the problem
- T defaultSolver : An object of the default solver for the problem
- U defaultVerifier : An object of the default verifier for the problem

The PROBLEMNAME\textunderscore class.cs should also include any necessary problem variables, any functions necessary for parsing string instances into variable, and two constructors. One constructor that takes a string instance, and one which uses the default instance. For any graph problems, use the objects and parsers found in Interfaces/graphs.

#### Solvers
The Solvers folder should contain all solver files for that problem. Each of which implements the SolverI interface found in SolverInterface.cs. This includes 

- string solverName : Human readable name of solving algorithm, this is what with appear in the GUI
- string solverDefinition : A brief description of the algorithm used to solve the problem
- string source : Formal citation of the source of the solving algorithm
- string[] contributors : A list of names of all developers who have worked on the solver

The file should also include a function which takes a problem object, and returns a string of the solution, as well as any other necessary functions.
*because for now all problems are NP-Complete, solution algorithms should return a complete solution.

#### Verifiers
The Verifiers folder should contain all verifier files for that problem. Each of which implements the VerifierI interface found in VerifierInterface.cs. This includes 

- string verifierName : Human readable name of verifier, this is what with appear in the GUI
- string verifierDefinition : A brief description of the algorithm used to verify the problem
- string source : Formal citation of the source of the verifier algorithm
- string[] contributors : A list of names of all developers who have worked on the verifier
            
The file should also include a function which takes a problem object and certificate, and returns a Boolean for if the certificate is a solution to the given problem. As well as any other necessary functions.

### API endpoints
When adding an API endpoint, the current practice is to add a controller into the problem reduction controller class, which corresponds to a specific class for that problem reduction. Meaning each reduction has its own controller, all in the controller class. The current naming convention is NameOfRelatedClassController. If not named correctly, the GUI will not function properly. Each controller should include [Route("controller")], and [Tag("Problem Name")].

When adding a Http call to a controller, xml comments must be added for them to be automatically added to our documentation using swaggerUI. These comments go above each Http call, and should include where ever applicable the following tags.

- &lt;summary&gt;Brief description of API call&lt;\summary&gt;
- &lt;param name=”paramaterName” example=”example of parameter”&gt;Description of parameter&lt;\param&gt;
- &lt;response code=”200”&gt;What call returns &lt\response&gt;

    
## DOD - Definition of Done
### New Problems
All added problems should fulfill the following requirements,

- Correctly implements all interfaces
- Includes at least one solver
- Includes at least one verifier
- Tests for all solvers and verifiers have been created and pass.

### New Reductions
All new reductions should fulfill the following requirments,

- Correctly implements all interfaces
- Includes working solution mapping function specific to reduction
- Is located in correct folder, for the problem its reducing from
- Has API endpoint which can return reduction info, reduced string, and mapped solution

### API additions
All API additions should fulfill the following requirements,

- The controller is named properly
- Controller is in the proper controller class for related problem
- Proper XML comments for all Http calls
