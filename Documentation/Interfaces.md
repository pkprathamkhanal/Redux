There are six main interfaces that each problem should implement to be a complete problem. Once these interfaces are implemented, they are automatically accessible with the existing API. Templates for all of the interfaces can be generated by going to the [main site](https://redux.portneuf.cose.isu.edu/), typing in the name of your problem, and clicking "add new problem". 

## String Fields
All interfaces have several string fields which describe the purposes and sources of that implementation.

## IProblem
The `IProblem` interface is the main interface when implementing a problem. It has three generic types, a `ISolver`, `IVerifier`, and an `IVisualization`. While a problem can have several of each of these, it needs to have a default implementation of each. An `IProblem` should have a constructor that builds a problem out of a string, and a constructor that builds a default problem. If your problem does not have a visualization, then the class `DummyVisualization` can be used. 

## IVerifier
The `IVerifier` interface is a verifier for its problem type. It needs to implement a boolean method `verify` that takes in the problem, a string representing the solution called a certificate, and returns if the certificate was a solution.

## ISolver
An `ISolver` needs a method that takes an instance of a problem, and returns the solution to that problem. It optionally can implement a `GetSteps` method that returns the first 99 steps as a list of string. Currently these strings should be in the same format as a solution certificate.

## IVisualization
An `IVisualization` needs a method `visualize` that takes a problem and returns and `API_JSON` object
